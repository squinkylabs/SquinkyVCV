# Seq++ mouse interface

## Selecting notes

Clicking on a note will select it, and deselect all others.

Ctrl-click on a note will toggle its selection state, while leaving any other selected notes selected.

Shift-click will extent the selection up to the cursor. This means all previously selected notes will stay selected, and all notes between the cursor and the selection will get selected, too.

## Inserting and deleting notes

TBD

## Changing notes

Transpose: if you click and hold in the middle of a selected note, you can drag all the selected notes up and down in pitch.

Shift: if you click and hold at the start of a selected note, you can drag all the selected notes left and right in time.

Stretch: if you click and hold at the end of a selected note, you can drag all the selected notes left and right in duration.
