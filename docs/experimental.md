# src folder

This folder contains the top-level Module source code. Almost all of our code that is specific to VCV Rack is in this folder.

Usually all of the code the actually generates and processes audio is elsewhere.

## Experimental Modules

The Thread Booster is quite experimental. It is described [here](thread-booster.md).
