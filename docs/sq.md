## What works now

Plays sequence looped all the time.s

Edit note attributes (pitch, start time, duration)

Draw Piano roll.

## What doesn't work.

There are obviously many missing features (clocking, start/stop, undo, saving sequences). There is no mouse interface. It looks horrible. There is no screen area top or bottom like you might expect to show where you are and what your are doing.

Note editor things that don't work:

* Viewport doesn't scroll, either in pitch or in time.
* Song ends at bar three - can't change length.
* While you can edit and play at the same time, it's just by luck.

## Piano roll

It works like you would expect. Details are in [Keyboard Summary](./keymap.md).

Note that there is a blinking "DOS cursor". It is not connected to the mouse cursor in any way. All note editing is done via the keyboard an this cursor.
