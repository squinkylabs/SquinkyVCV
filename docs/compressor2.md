## About Comp 2

Comp2 is a 16 channel compressor designed to work with Mind Meld mixers, and other mixers that can send and receive effects on polyphonic cables.

The compression functionality is identical to our previous compressor, Comp. So if you are not familiar with Comp you should look at [its manual](./compressor.md).

This manual for Comp2 will only talk about additions on top of what Comp already does.

## Independent control of each channel

In mono mode, there are 16 independent channels, each with their own settings. In the two stereo modes, there are 8 independent stereo pairs of channels. Each pair share settings.

The _channel_ knob selects which channel is being edited by the front panel. The other channels are not effected by edits of compression settings from the panel.

## Stereo

Stereo mode is actually "dual mono", where the left and right sides have completely independent compressors. The left and right share the same parameters (knob settings), but they will compress independently.

## Linked stereo

Linked stereo makes the gains the same in the left and right channels. This keeps thinks from moving left to right as they are compressed.

Linked stereo is usually preferred is you are trying to create a sound field where various instruments stay fixed left to right, and where you don't want instruments jumping around if they get loud.

Stereo (multi-mono), on the other hand, can keep a very firm hand on the dynamics, and prevent either side from getting louder than desired.

In the end, use whichever sounds better to you.
