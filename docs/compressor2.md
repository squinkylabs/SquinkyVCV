## About Comp 2

Comp2 is a 16 channel compressor designed to work with Mind Meld mixers, and other mixers that can send and receive effects on polyphonic cables.

The compression functionality is identical to our previous compressor, Comp. So if you are not familiar with Comp you should look at [its manual](./compressor.md).

This manual for Comp2 will only talk about additions on top of what Comp already does.
