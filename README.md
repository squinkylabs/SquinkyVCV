## Installing binaries
Download the current release from our [releases page](https://github.com/squinkylabs/SquinkyVCV/releases).
Follow the standard instructions for installing third-party plugins in rack: [here](https://vcvrack.com/manual/Installing.html)

Note that the built-in unzip in windows explorer will create an extra folder called with the same name as the zip file. But when everything is unzipped you want your folder structure to look like this:
```
plugins/
    <other plugins>
    squinkylabs-plug1/
        plugin.dll
        plugin.dylib
        plugin.so
        LICENSE
        res/   
            <one or more svg files>
            <possibly other resources
```
    
## More information for programmers, builders, and experimenters

There are "secret" modules, extra code and other things scattered around this repo. Pointers to some of it can be found [in the docs folder](./docs/README.md).

## VCV Rack version 0.6.0
The next version of VCV Rack is coming soon. Version 0.5.x plugins will not work with version 0.6.0.

We have ported our code to VCV 0.6.0. Our "master" branch is now 0.6.0 compatible. Plugins built from master will run in VCV Rack 0.6.0dev, and will not run in any 0.5.x versions of VCV Rack.

Please report any issues running in VCV Rack 0.6.0 on our GitHub issues page.

Like most plugin developers, we will update our releases and post in the Plugin Manager once 0.6 ships.
